# Update 4/15/2019

This year, PySCF will celebrate the 5th anniversary of its first commit. In this short period, PySCF has changed from being a single-group code to one relied on daily by over 100 research teams in academia and industry across the world. The PySCF paper was one of the 10 most downloaded articles in WIREs Computational Molecular Science in 2018!

Today we are excited to announce a new model for managing the future development and directions of the code. This responsibility will now fall to the PySCF board of directors. The initial board members will be:

- Timothy Berkelbach, Columbia and Flatiron Institute
- Garnet Chan, Caltech
- Sandeep Sharma, UC Boulder
- Alexander Sokolov, Ohio State
- Qiming Sun, Tencent Quantum Laboratory
  

The aims of the board will be to:
1. maintain the continued high quality of the existing codebase
2. assess proposals for new features and pull requests
3. coordinate development and education across the community
4. ensure adequate funding for these efforts

Stay tuned for more updates soon on our new activities!
